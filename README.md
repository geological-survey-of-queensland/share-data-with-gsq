# How to transfer data with between your cloud instance and GSQ

## Sharing files with GSQ
You can share large files, or a lot of files, with GSQ through the following methods:

* [S3 to S3 data transfer](https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/share-data-with-gsq/blob/master/s3-to-s3-copy.md) - securely transfer files between your AWS account and GSQ's AWS account.  
WE DO NOT HAVE SOLUTIONS FOR THE BELOW YET

* [Azure Storage to S3 data transfer](https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/share-data-with-gsq/blob/master/azure-storage-to-s3.md) - securely transfer files between your Azure account and GSQ's AWS account.
* [AWS Snowball data transfer](https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/share-data-with-gsq/blob/master/gsq-userguides/snowball-gsq-userguide.md) - securely transfer files between your data centre or local network and GSQ's AWS storage using a physical device.

For all other data transfer options, please contact us at GSQOpenData@dnrme.qld.gov.au

## Copying files from GSQ's AWS S3 Buckets
All files presented in the [Open Data Portal](https://geoscience.data.qld.gov.au/)  can be directly downloaded using the download button.  Users can also add multiple files to a cart and request a package of these files.  Users who want to copy and very large files (or a large number of files) from the GSQ S3 buckets to their own cloud solution can request access to set up an outgoing transfer:
* [S3 to S3 data transfer](https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/share-data-with-gsq/blob/master/s3-to-s3-copy.md) - securely transfer files between GSQ's AWS account and your AWS account.

* [Azure Storage to S3 data transfer](https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/share-data-with-gsq/blob/master/azure-storage-to-s3.md) - securely transfer files between your Azure account and GSQ's AWS account.
* [AWS Snowball data transfer](https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/share-data-with-gsq/blob/master/gsq-userguides/snowball-gsq-userguide.md) - securely transfer files between your data centre or local network and GSQ's AWS storage using a physical device.
